In this guide, I will walk through how to create a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate for an NGINX web server on macOS.

## Overview

TLS, or transport layer security, and its predecessor SSL, which stands for secure sockets layer, are web protocols used to wrap normal traffic in a protected, encrypted wrapper.

Using this technology, servers can send traffic safely between the server and clients without the possibility of the messages being intercepted by outside parties. The certificate system also assists users in verifying the identity of the sites that they are connecting with.

While a self-signed certificate will encrypt communication between your server and any clients, it cannot be used to verify the authenticity of the connection. This is due to the fact that a self-signed certificate is not signed by any of the trusted certificate authorities included with the browser's trusted root store.

A CA-signed certificate is preferred in *all* cases where the web interface is user-facing, however there are instances where creating a self-signed certificate is necessary. For example, when setting up a reverse proxy server in front of a local development server to proxy SSL traffic to the server.

## Understanding SSL/TLS

SSL/TLS works by using the combination of a public certificate and a private key. The SSL key is kept secret on the server. It is used to encrypt content sent to clients. The SSL certificate is publicly shared with anyone requesting the content. It can be used to decrypt the content signed by the associated SSL key.

## Step 0: (Update) Address `net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` in Chrome

The following recommendations were made by [Victor Combal-Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorcombalweiss/) on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43665243/invalid-self-signed-ssl-cert-subject-alternative-name-missing/56530824#56530824):

To fix the following error:

> This site is missing a valid, trusted certificate (`net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`).

Copy `openssl.cnf`:

```bash
cp /System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf openssl.cnf
```

Add the following to `openssl.cnf`:

```bash
[ v3_ca  ]
subjectAltName = DNS:localhost
```

## Step 1: Create the SSL Certificate

* Create the requisite directories:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/ssl/private
```

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs
```

* Create a key and certificate pair:

```bash
sudo openssl req \
  -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -config nginx/openssl.cnf \
  -keyout /usr/local/etc/ssl/private/self-signed.key \
  -out /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/self-signed.crt
```

**Note**: This will create both a key file and a certificate.

## Step 2: Create a Diffie-Hellman Key Pair

```bash
sudo openssl dhparam -out /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 128
```

**Note**: This will take a *long* time depending on how many bits are specified. For our purposes, 128 bits is enough.

## Step 3: Create *snippets* to use with NGINX

* Create the requisite directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/nginx/snippets
```

* Create the `self-signed.conf` snippet:

```bash
touch /usr/local/etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
```

* Set `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`:

```bash
sudo vim /usr/local/etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
```

`self-signed.conf`

```bash
ssl_certificate /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/self-signed.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/etc/ssl/private/self-signed.key;
```

* Create the `ssl-params.conf` snippet:

```bash
touch /usr/local/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
```

```bash
sudo vim /usr/local/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
```

`ssl-params.conf`

```bash
ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH";
ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_session_tickets off;
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
resolver_timeout 5s;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains";
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
ssl_dhparam /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
```

## Step 4: Configure NGINX to use SSL/TLS

* Configure `nginx.conf`:

```bash
sudo vim /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

`nginx.conf`

```bash
worker_processes  1;

events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
  include       mime.types;
  default_type  application/octet-stream;

  sendfile           on;
  keepalive_timeout  65;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;

  # configure nginx server to redirect to HTTPS
  server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;
    return 302 https://$server_name:443;
  }

  # configure nginx server with ssl
  server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    server_name  localhost;
    include snippets/self-signed.conf;
    include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

    # route requests to the local development server
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:1313/;
    }
  }

  include servers/*;
}
```

**Note**: Any hard-coded references using *http* must be changed to use *https*.

## Step 5: Restart the NGINX server

* Check for syntax errors in `nginx.conf`:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

* Restart the NGINX server:

```bash
sudo nginx -s stop && sudo nginx
```

## Step 6: Test your encryption

Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost).

Because the certificate we created isn't signed by one of the system's trusted certificate authorities, you should be greeted with a big warning sign and the admonition **Your connection is not private**. To remedy this, we need to add the self-signed certificate to the trusted root store.

## Step 7: Add the self-signed certificate to the trusted root store

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert \
  -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/self-signed.crt
```

## Addendum

I created a GitHub repository, [Self-Signed](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/self-signed), which provides a working example of how to create a self-signed certificate for NGINX.

## Acknowledgments

Again, I would like to thank [Victor Combal-Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorcombalweiss/) for informing me of Chrome's updated trusted certificate policy.
